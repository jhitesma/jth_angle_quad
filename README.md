# UBMQ - Angled Arms OpenSCAD Edition
250 sized quadcopter with angled arms designed in openscad 

This is based on my [UBMQ (Ultra Budget Mini Quad)] (http://forum.flitetest.com/showthread.php?11288-When-inspiration-hits) design I tossed together one day to get some parts in the air while I was waiting on a custom cut carbon fiber frame.  It flew well but arms tend to break easily, they're cheap and easy to replace but it gets annoying. Not something I'd want to fly long term but great for quick tests.

The arms are angled 10% inwards by the printed center section.  Each 1/2" wood dowel arm is secured with two bolts that run through it but they should be a tight fit to begin.  The printed section is primarialy to hold the angle on the arms, the plates and bolts should give most of the strength. 

Motor mount was [shared on Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1490002 title="Motor Mount") already.
